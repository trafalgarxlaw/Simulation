    [-d|--distribution VALUES] [-i|--interactive]

Simulates a cellular automaton.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help                  Shows this help message and exit
  -r, --num-rows VALUE        The number of rows.
                              The default value is 5.
  -c, --num-cols VALUE        The number of columns.
                              The default value is 5.
  -n, --num-steps VALUE       The number of steps in the simulation.
                              The default value is 5.
  -t, --type STRING           The type of simulation.
                              Currently, there are 3 supported types:
                              "game-of-life", "pandemy" and "fire".
                              The default type is "game-of-life".
  -b, --boundary STRING       The boundary type.
                              Currently, there are 2 supported types:
                              "truncate" and "periodic".
                              The default boundary is "truncate".
  -a, --allowed-cells STRING  The allowed cells, as characters.
                              The number of cells must be consistent
                              with the type of simulation.
  -d, --distribution VALUES   The initial probability distribution,
                              which are comma-separated positive values.
                              E.g: if the allowed cells are "abc"
                              and the distribution is "1,1,2", then, 'c'
                              will appear twice as more as 'a' and 'b'.
  -i, --interactive           Enables interactive simulation.
